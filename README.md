# MachineLearning

Homeworks and Projects in the NJIT CS 675 Machine Learning Course. The detailed descriptions are in https://web.njit.edu/~usman/courses/cs675_spring20/index.html

Libraries such as Numpy or sklearn are not allowed for the homeworks, so implement an algorithm without any Python Library. Projects are more real life applications and some libraries are allowed. 

## HW1

## HW2
