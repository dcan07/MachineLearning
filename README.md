# MachineLearning

Homeworks and Projects in the NJIT CS 675 Machine Learning Course. The detailed descriptions are in https://web.njit.edu/~usman/courses/cs675_spring20/index.html

Libraries such as Numpy or sklearn are not allowed for the homeworks, so implement an algorithm without any Python Library. Projects are more real life applications and some libraries are allowed. 

## HW1
Naive Bayes classifier
### HW2
Gradient descent for minimizing the least squares loss
### HW3
Implement SVM hinge loss gradient descent 
### HW3b
Implement SVM hinge loss gradient descent with regularization
### HW4
Logistic discrimination gradient descent algorithm
### HW5 - Hinge adaptive eta
Implement SVM hinge loss gradient descent with adaptive eta (learning rate)
### HW6
Decision stump that determines the column with the best split for the CART decision tree algorithm
### HW7
Bagged decision stump
### HW8
K-means clustering
## Project 1
This is a simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data containing 29623 SNPs (total features). Amongst all SNPs are 15 causal ones which means they and neighboring ones discriminate between case and controls while remainder are noise. Discriminate between case and controls using minimum number of features. It is a feature selection project.
## Project 2
Random hyperplanes for classification with SVM
## Project 3
Time series prediction using linear regression and moving lookback window
## Project 4
Spam mail classification using SVM and TFIDF encoding
